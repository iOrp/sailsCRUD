# sailsCRUD

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

This Sails Application hereto referred as sailsCRUD, is a simple [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) Starter application illustrating basic CRUD operations on [Sails.js](http://sailsjs.org).

In computer programming, create, read, update and delete (as an acronym CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Alternate words are sometimes used when defining the four basic functions of CRUD, retrieve instead of read, modify instead of update, or destroy instead of delete.

This application is based upon a single api i.e. ipsum comprising of the IpsumController and the ipsum model.

The routes are configured at routes.js.

Initially default connection is set at connections.js with the myMongoDbObject using a myDb database.

To Use this application:

* Install node.js
* Install sails.js
* Run npm install to install all the dependencies
* Install MongoDB

Optional:
* Install MongoChef : Have a logical view of MongoDB
* Install Postman : Test the various apis

And yes, then you are good to go in the development server.
'sails lift' to see the magic.
